1. tell git who ur 

git config --global user.name "arun"
git config --global user.email "arukumar.m5395@gmail.com

2. Create a folder in arunkumar directory(local machine) as GitSelenium and paste the projects which stored from eclipse.

3. enter the created folder name in CMD prompt as cd GitSelenium
4.Enter git init(need to initialise the folder to to git or initialise it as Git repository)

5.Commit (Create 100 files and we know 80 files ready to push github and 20 files we dont want to commit right now)

9.Connect to a remote repostitory (git remote add origin https://github.com/Arun99M/selenium.git)we need to give the git origin to connect remote repository with local repo.

10.  git push origin master  (need to push the code to git repo and origin refers to the git origin and master is a branch)

11.git clone (it is nothing but it downloads the fresh code from the git this for the 1st time)

IF WE have 2 teammates working on same project.

1. git pull origin master (from 2nd time only the code need to fetch which is updated one)


BRANCHING:

1.git checkout -b develop (b stand for create a new branch )

2.git branch (it is used for to check the which branch we were in)

3.git push origin develop  (used to move the code to develop)

4.git pull origin develop (used to downlaod the code which made by other team person).
